## 🚀 What It Does

You input a **topic or idea**. The system runs through four specialized agents to help you clarify your thinking and generate actionable insights.

### 🧩 4-Step Workflow

---

### 🧠 Agent 1: `brainstorm_ideas`

A collaborative and curious partner for raw ideation.

**Purpose**: Collect unstructured thoughts, emotional reactions, screenshots, voice notes, and rants — anything that helps explore early product directions.

**Output**:
- A numbered list of ideas
- Each with a title, description, and potential value

---

### 🔍 Agent 2: `summarize_brainstormideas`

A pattern-sensing AI that clusters raw inputs into insight themes.

**Purpose**: Spot behavioral or emotional patterns in your brainstormed ideas — without filtering or reducing creativity.

**Output**:
- Evocative theme titles
- 1–2 sentence summaries of tensions or needs
- Linked quotes/fragments supporting each theme

---

### 🧪 Agent 3: `shape_hypothesis`

A product strategy engine that converts insights into testable ideas.

**Purpose**: Translate themes into creative product directions and hypotheses about user behavior or beliefs.

**Output**:
- Product or service ideas
- Variations or stretch concepts
- Testable hypotheses tied to user tension

---

### 📋 Agent 4: `generate_survey`

A user-research assistant that creates clear, empathetic surveys.

**Purpose**: Design a structured survey that validates the riskiest assumptions — in user-friendly language.

**Output**:
- Warm-up section (demographics, lifestyle)
- Per-hypothesis survey questions (Likert, multiple choice, follow-ups)
- Optional closing section for open feedback
- Total ~12–15 thoughtful questions
